## Basic execution

Please see our [installation guide](installation.md) to learn how to set up this pipeline first. 

A basic execution of the pipeline looks as follows:

a) Without a site-specific config file

```bash
nextflow run marchoeppner/gabi -profile singularity --input /path/top/run_folder \\
--reference_base /path/to/references \\
--run_name pipeline-test
```

where `path_to_references` corresponds to the location in which you have [installed](installation.md) the pipeline references (this can be omitted to trigger an on-the-fly temporary installation, but is not recommended in production). 

In this example, the pipeline will assume it runs on a single computer with the singularity container engine available. Available options to provision software are:

`-profile singularity`

`-profile docker` 

`-profile podman` 

`-profile conda` 

Additional software provisioning tools as described [here](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/container.html) may also work, but have not been tested by us. Please note that conda may not work for all packages on all platforms. If this turns out to be the case for you, please consider switching to one of the supported container engines. 

b) with a site-specific config file

```bash
nextflow run marchoeppner/gabi -profile lsh --input /path/top/run_folder \\
--run_name pipeline-test 
```

In this example, both `--reference_base` and the choice of software provisioning are already set in the local configuration `lsh` and don't have to be provided as command line argument. 

## Options

### `--input` [ default = null ]

Path to a Illumina run directory.

### `---samplesheet`[ default = null ]

Path to the corresponding sample sheet. If not provided, the pipeline will look for it inside the run directory (SampleSheet.csv).

### `--run_name` [ default = null ]

A unique name for this analysis; will be used to name the final report.
